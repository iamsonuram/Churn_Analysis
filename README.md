# Churn Analysis and Prediction Project
## Overview
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard and related files for analyzing customer churn and making predictions based on the provided dataset.
Files

- Churn_Analysis.pbix: Power BI file containing the churn analysis dashboard with interactive visualizations.
- Churn_Predication.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the predictive modeling code for churn analysis.
- Prediction_Data.xlsx: Excel file with the raw dataset used for analysis and predictions.
- Predictions.csv: CSV file with the prediction results generated from the model.
- README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on customer churn analysis using Power BI for visualization and a Python-based predictive model. The dashboard (Churn_Analysis.pbix) offers insights into churn trends, while the Jupyter Notebook (Churn_Predication.ipynb) includes the machine learning pipeline to predict churn based on the Prediction_Data.xlsx dataset. The results are exported as Predictions.csv.
### How to Use
#### Power BI Dashboard

- Open Churn_Analysis.pbix in Power BI Desktop.
- Explore the interactive charts and filters to analyze churn patterns.
- Publish to Power BI Service for sharing (public link available upon request).

#### Predictive Model

- Run Churn_Predication.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook with the required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn).
- Update the data path in the notebook to point to Prediction_Data.xlsx.

#### Dataset

- Use Prediction_Data.xlsx or Predictions.csv for further analysis or validation.

### Skills Demonstrated

- Data analysis and visualization with Power BI.
- Predictive modeling with Python and Jupyter Notebook.
- Data preprocessing and result export.
